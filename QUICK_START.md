# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Getting Your Project on GitHub

Welcome! This is your simple starting point. Follow these steps in order.

## ✅ What I've Prepared for You

1. **README.md** - Professional project documentation
2. **.gitignore** - Protects your sensitive files (like API keys)
3. **GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Detailed step-by-step GitHub instructions
4. **PORTFOLIO_INTEGRATION.md** - How to showcase your project
5. **VERCEL_DOMAIN_GUIDE.md** - Switch from GoDaddy to free Vercel domain

## 🎯 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Review Your Files
- ✅ Check that `config.local.js` is NOT being tracked (it's in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Review `README.md` and update with your name/info if needed

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub
1. Open **GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md**
2. Follow the instructions step-by-step
3. Don't skip the Personal Access Token step!

### Step 3: Upload Your Project
- Follow the commands in the GitHub guide
- Your code will be safely stored on GitHub

### Step 4: Add to Portfolio
- Open **PORTFOLIO_INTEGRATION.md**
- Choose a hosting option (GitHub Pages is easiest)
- Add to your LinkedIn/resume

## ⚠️ Important Security Note

**Before uploading to GitHub:**
- ✅ `config.local.js` is already in `.gitignore` (safe!)
- ✅ Your API keys won't be uploaded
- ✅ Double-check by running `git status` - you shouldn't see `config.local.js`
