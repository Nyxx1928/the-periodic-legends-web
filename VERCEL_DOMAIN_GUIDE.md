# Switching from GoDaddy to Vercel Free Domain

This guide will help you switch from your paid GoDaddy domain to Vercel's completely free domain, saving you money on domain renewals.

## 🎯 What You'll Get

Vercel automatically provides a **free subdomain** for every project:
- Format: `your-project-name.vercel.app`
- Example: `the-periodic-legends.vercel.app`
- ✅ **Completely free** - no expiration date
- ✅ **SSL certificate included** (HTTPS)
- ✅ **Fast CDN** - global performance
- ✅ **Automatic deployments** - updates when you push to GitHub

## 📋 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access Your Vercel Project

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in
2. Click on your **The Periodic Legends** project
3. Go to **Settings** (top menu)

### Step 2: Remove GoDaddy Domain

1. In Settings, click **Domains** (left sidebar)
2. You should see your GoDaddy domain listed (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Click the **three dots (⋯)** next to your GoDaddy domain
4. Select **Remove** or **Delete**
5. Confirm the removal

**What happens:**
- Your site will still work on the free Vercel domain
- The GoDaddy domain will stop pointing to your site
- You can let GoDaddy expire without issues

### Step 3: Find Your Free Vercel Domain

1. Still in the **Domains** section
2. Look for a domain ending in `.vercel.app`
3. This is your **free domain** - it looks like:
   ```
   your-project-name.vercel.app
   ```
   or
   ```
   your-project-name-abc123.vercel.app
   ```

4. **Copy this URL** - this is your new website address!

### Step 4: Test Your Free Domain

1. Open a new browser tab
2. Paste your `.vercel.app` URL
3. Your website should load perfectly!

### Step 5: Update Any Links (Optional)

If you have links to your website elsewhere, update them:

- **GitHub README.md**: Update the live demo link
- **Portfolio websites**: Update project links
- **Social media**: Update bio links
- **Resume**: Update project URLs

## 🔄 What Happens to GoDaddy?

### Before May 20, 2025:
- Your GoDaddy domain still works (until expiration)
- Your Vercel free domain also works
- Both point to the same site

### After May 20, 2025:
- GoDaddy domain expires (stops working)
- Vercel free domain continues working forever
- **No action needed** - just use the Vercel domain

### Important Notes:
- ✅ **Don't renew** GoDaddy - you don't need it
- ✅ **No downtime** - your site keeps working on Vercel
- ✅ **Free forever** - Vercel domains don't expire

## 🎨 Customizing Your Vercel Domain

### Option 1: Use the Default Domain
- Format: `your-project-name.vercel.app`
- Already set up and working
- No configuration needed

### Option 2: Request a Custom Subdomain (Free)
You can request a slightly customized version:
1. Go to Vercel Settings → Domains
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Try variations like:
   - `tpl.vercel.app`
   - `periodic-legends.vercel.app`
   - `yourname-tpl.vercel.app`

**Note:** Custom subdomains are subject to availability, but `.vercel.app` domains are usually available.

## 📝 Updating Your Project Links

### In Your Code (if needed):

If you have any hardcoded domain references, you can update them, but this is usually not necessary since Vercel handles routing automatically.

### In Documentation:

Update these files with your new Vercel domain:

1. **README.md** - Add a "Live Demo" section:
   ```markdown
   ## 🌐 Live Demo
   
   Visit the live website: [https://your-project.vercel.app](https://your-project.vercel.app)
   ```

2. **PORTFOLIO_INTEGRATION.md** - Update example URLs

3. **GitHub Repository** - Add website URL:
   - Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Pages
   - Add your Vercel URL in the "Website" field

## 🔒 Security & SSL

✅ **SSL Certificate**: Automatically included (HTTPS)
✅ **Secure**: Your site uses HTTPS by default
✅ **No configuration needed**: Vercel handles everything

## 💰 Cost Comparison

### GoDaddy (Current):
- Domain: ~$10-15/year
- Expires: May 20, 2025
- **Total cost**: Ongoing annual fees

### Vercel Free Domain:
- Domain: **$0/year**
- Expires: **Never**
- **Total cost**: **FREE forever**

**Savings**: $10-15+ per year indefinitely!

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Pros of Vercel Free Domain:
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ Never expires
- ✅ SSL included
- ✅ Fast CDN
- ✅ Automatic deployments

### Cons (Minor):
- ⚠️ Domain includes `.vercel.app` (not a custom `.com`)
- ⚠️ Slightly longer URL
- ⚠️ Less "brandable" than a custom domain

**For a portfolio/thesis project**: The free Vercel domain is perfectly professional and acceptable!
